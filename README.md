# 16-bit-shift-rotate-ALU
This is an implementation of shift right, shift left, rotate left and rotate right operations on a 16-bit ALU using verilog

## Output
Output obtained when the operations are performed on the input i0 = 16'b1000000000000101

Here,
* **i0** : Input number
* **shift_by** : Amount of bits to be shifted/rotated
* **choice** : Options encoded to choose the operation to be performed (i.e. shift/rotate operations)
* **rotate_left** : Ouput after performing rotate left operation
* **rotate_right** : Ouput after performing rotate right operation
* **shift_left** : Ouput after performing shift left operation
* **shift_right** : Ouput after performing shift right operation
* **final_output** : This is the ouput after performing the operation
